# pypong
pypong is my first attempt at writing a pong game in python.
pypong uses pygame, random, and time imports.
Base code is built off of the realpython.com pygame tutorial. Some code lines have not been changed.

###Controls
Player 1 (Left Paddle) is controllled by the "W" and "S" keys.
Player 2 (Right Paddle) is controlled with teh "UP" and "DOWN" arrows.

To launch the ball use the "SPACE" key.

Play continues until one player reached 5 points.
Game can be exited at any time by hitting "ESC" or clicking the close window button.
